# Story 1.5: Fix Branch Name Truncation

## Status: Learning Extracted

## Story

- As a **developer**
- I want **to see the meaningful part of branch names when they are truncated**
- so that **I can quickly identify which branch I'm working on**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. **AC1**: Branch names truncated from prefix (beginning) instead of suffix (end)
2. **AC2**: Most specific part of branch name (suffix) remains visible when truncated
3. **AC3**: Truncation logic works consistently across all display contexts
4. **AC4**: Real-time preview during branch creation shows truncated result
5. **AC5**: Truncation respects terminal width constraints

## Current Problem

Branch names are currently truncated from the suffix (end), hiding the most specific and useful information. For example, "feature/epic1/story5/enhanced-vis..." shows "feature/epic1/story5/enhanced-vis..." but should show "...story5/enhanced-visualization" to preserve the most meaningful part.

## Technical Implementation

- Modify branch truncation logic in `ui/list.go` (lines ~212-219)
- Change from `branch[:remainingWidth-3] + "..."` to `"..." + branch[len(branch)-(remainingWidth-3):]`
- Add real-time preview in project input during branch creation
- Handle edge cases (very short names, exact width matches)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Update branch truncation logic (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Locate current truncation logic in ui/list.go
  - [x] Implement suffix-preserving truncation algorithm
  - [x] Test with various branch name lengths and patterns
  - [x] Ensure consistent behavior across all UI contexts
- [ ] Task 2: Add real-time preview (AC: 4)
  - [x] Implement preview logic helper functions
  - [ ] Show truncated result during branch name entry (deferred)
  - [ ] Update preview dynamically as user types (deferred)
- [x] Task 3: Terminal width handling (AC: 5)
  - [x] Ensure truncation respects current terminal width
  - [x] Handle dynamic terminal resizing
  - [x] Test edge cases with very narrow terminals
- [x] Task 4: Edge case handling
  - [x] Handle branch names shorter than truncation threshold
  - [x] Handle exact width matches
  - [x] Validate behavior with special characters

## Definition of Done

- [x] Branch names show suffix when truncated across all UI contexts
- [ ] Real-time preview shows accurate truncation during input (helper functions implemented, UI integration deferred)
- [x] All edge cases handled gracefully
- [x] Terminal width constraints respected
- [x] No regression in existing branch display functionality
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Code follows project standards (gofmt, go vet)

## Business Context

This UX improvement addresses developer frustration with current branch name truncation that hides the most important information. By preserving the suffix (most specific part), developers can quickly identify their working branch without needing to expand or scroll through full names.

## Priority

**P1 (UX Fix)** - High priority user experience improvement that directly impacts developer workflow efficiency.

## Epic Alignment

This story aligns with Epic 1's focus on "fixing what's broken and polishing what's working" by addressing a specific UX pain point in the branch display system without adding new features.
