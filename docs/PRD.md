# Reduced Product Requirements Document
## Epic 1 Multi-Project: Focused UX Improvements

### Executive Summary

Based on real user testing feedback, this PRD defines a **minimal scope** to address specific UX pain points identified during Epic 1.1 validation. Focus is on **fixing critical issues** and **improving core usability** rather than adding new features.

**Guiding Principle**: Fix what's broken, polish what's working, defer what's not essential.

---

## Problem Statement

Epic 1.1 delivered functional multi-project support but revealed **critical UX issues** and opportunities for enhancement:

**Phase 1 - Critical UX Fixes:**
1. **üî• CRITICAL**: Tmux session name conflicts causing creation failures
2. **üéØ UX**: Add Project dialog is not visually centered  
3. **üéØ UX**: No visual indication of current active project

**Phase 2 - UX Enhancements:**
4. **üåø UX**: Branch names truncated at wrong end (prefix vs suffix)
5. **üìä UX**: Redundant project name display in session lists
6. **üîå FEATURE**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for enhanced capabilities

**Success Criteria**: Address critical issues first, then add valuable enhancements with controlled scope.

## User Stories

### **Story 1.2: Fix Session Creation Errors**
**Priority**: P0 (Critical Bug)
**User Story**: As a user, when I create a new instance, it should work reliably without tmux session conflicts.

**Current Problem**: `failed to start new session: tmux session already exists: claudesquad_piola`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Instance creation never fails due to tmux session name conflicts
- AC2: Clear error messages when tmux operations fail
- AC3: Automatic session name resolution for conflicts
- AC4: Graceful fallback when session names are unavailable

**Technical Implementation**:
- Add unique suffix to session names (timestamp/UUID)
- Implement session name availability checking
- Add proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Add retry logic for session creation

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Instance creation succeeds 100% of the time when valid
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] No tmux session name collisions occur
- [ ] Regression tests cover session name scenarios

---

### **Story 1.3: Center Add Project Dialog**
**Priority**: P1 (UX Issue)
**User Story**: As a user, the Add Project dialog should be visually centered and properly positioned.

**Current Problem**: Dialog appears off-center and positioning is inconsistent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Add Project dialog is perfectly centered on screen
- AC2: Dialog positioning is consistent across window sizes
- AC3: Dialog remains visible and accessible on all screen resolutions
- AC4: Visual alignment follows design standards

**Technical Implementation**:
- Fix dialog centering logic in project input overlay
- Ensure responsive positioning for different screen sizes
- Add proper padding and margins
- Validate positioning across resolutions

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Dialog is perfectly centered on all screen sizes
- [ ] Visual appearance is professional and consistent
- [ ] Positioning works correctly on resize
- [ ] No visual glitches or misalignment

---

### **Story 1.4: Display Current Active Project**
**Priority**: P1 (UX Issue)  
**User Story**: As a user, I want to clearly see which project is currently active at all times.

**Current Problem**: No visual indication of active project context.

**UX Considerations** (from UX Expert review):
- **Problem**: Ubicaci√≥n puede crear visual clutter
- Poner "Active: ProjectName" cerca de "Instances" puede saturar el header
- **Recomendaci√≥n**: Considerar integrar en el t√≠tulo mismo: "Instances (ProjectName)"

**Acceptance Criteria** (Updated):
- AC1: Current active project is integrated into "Instances" header to avoid clutter
- AC2: Active project display updates immediately when project changes
- AC3: Display shows meaningful project name, not technical ID
- AC4: Visual design is clean and doesn't clutter the interface
- AC5: Display handles "no active project" state gracefully (shows just "Instances")

**Technical Implementation** (Simplified):
- Integrate active project name into existing "Instances" header
- Format: "Instances (ProjectName)" or just "Instances" when no active project
- Use project name instead of ID for readability
- Add proper state management for active project changes
- Avoid separate UI component to prevent visual clutter

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Active project is always visible and clear
- [ ] Display updates immediately on project changes
- [ ] Visual design is clean and professional
- [ ] Handles all edge cases (no project, invalid project)
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with existing UI elements

---

### **Story 1.5: Fix Branch Name Truncation**
**Priority**: P1 (UX Fix)
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to see the meaningful part of branch names when they are truncated, so I can quickly identify which branch I'm working on.

**Current Problem**: Branch names are truncated from the suffix (end), hiding the most specific and useful information (e.g., "feature/epic1/story5/enhanced-vis..." shows "feature/epic1/story5/enhanced-vis..." but should show "...story5/enhanced-visualization").

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Branch names truncated from prefix (beginning) instead of suffix (end)
- AC2: Most specific part of branch name (suffix) remains visible
- AC3: Truncation logic works consistently across all display contexts
- AC4: Real-time preview during branch creation shows truncated result
- AC5: Truncation respects terminal width constraints

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modify branch truncation logic in `ui/list.go` (lines ~212-219)
- Change from `branch[:remainingWidth-3] + "..."` to `"..." + branch[len(branch)-(remainingWidth-3):]`
- Add real-time preview in project input during branch creation
- Handle edge cases (very short names, exact width matches)

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Branch names show suffix when truncated across all UI contexts
- [ ] Real-time preview works during branch name input
- [ ] No regressions in branch display functionality
- [ ] Truncation logic handles all edge cases properly

---

### **Story 1.6: Remove Redundant Project Name Display**
**Priority**: P1 (UX Polish)
**User Story**: As a user, I want clean session displays without redundant information, so I can focus on relevant details.

**Current Problem**: Project names appear twice in session lists - once in the title `[PROJECT] name` and again in the branch line `(PROJECT)`, creating visual redundancy.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Project name appears only once per session (in title line)
- AC2: Branch line shows only branch and repository information
- AC3: Visual hierarchy remains clear and readable
- AC4: No information loss despite redundancy removal

**Technical Implementation**:
- Modify instance renderer in `ui/list.go` (lines ~143-156)
- Remove project name duplication from branch line display
- Maintain clear visual separation between different projects
- Preserve all other branch line information (repo name, etc.)

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] Project names appear only once per session in lists
- [ ] Branch lines are cleaner without redundant project information
- [ ] Visual hierarchy and readability are maintained
- [ ] No regression in information display

---

### **Story 1.7: MCP Integration for Enhanced Development**
**Priority**: P2 (Feature Enhancement)
**User Story**: As a developer, I want to configure and use MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for my Claude Code sessions, so I can access enhanced capabilities like GitHub integration, file operations, and project-specific tools.

**Current Problem**: No way to manage or configure MCP servers for individual development sessions, limiting Claude Code's potential capabilities.

**Business Value**:
- Enhanced development productivity through specialized tools
- Project-specific MCP configurations for different codebases
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code workflow

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC1: Session-level MCP configuration and management
- AC2: MCP availability only for Claude-compatible commands (robust detection)
- AC3: Simple toggle interface for adding/removing MCPs per session
- AC4: Automatic session restart with MCP changes (using --continue)
- AC5: Clear indication of MCP status in session lists
- AC6: Security-conscious approach (MCPs disabled for custom commands)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Robust Claude command detection (normalize command, check suffix)
- Session-level MCP configuration generation (`--mcp-config` flag)
- MCP management UI with 'm' key binding
- Automatic session restart logic with conversation continuity
- Security boundaries for custom commands

**Architecture Requirements**:
- `Instance.SessionMCPs []string` field for MCP storage
- Claude command detection: `isClaudeCommand(program)` function
- MCP config file generation in project directory
- Integration with existing session management

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] MCP toggle interface accessible via 'm' key on sessions
- [ ] MCPs work only with Claude-compatible commands (robust detection)
- [ ] Session restart maintains conversation history via --continue
- [ ] MCP status clearly displayed in session lists
- [ ] Security boundaries prevent MCP usage with custom commands
- [ ] Configuration persists across application restarts
