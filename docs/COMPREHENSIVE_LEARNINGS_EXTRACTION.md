## üîÑ WORKFLOW & PROCESS LEARNINGS

### Implementation-First Development Workflow

**Source References**:
- `docs/process-learnings/epic1-story8-integration-gap-learnings.md:15-45` - Critical gap identification
- `docs/epics/epic1.retrospective.md:89-120` - Process improvement outcomes
- `docs/stories/epic1.story8.story.md:445-490` - Implementation verification requirements

**Key Learning**: Documentation-only completion creates 200% estimation variance and implementation gaps.

**Established Workflow**:
1. **Implementation First**: Always code before marking complete
2. **Verification Gates**: Mandatory testing of actual functionality
3. **Documentation Alignment**: Real-time sync between docs and implementation
4. **Quality Checkpoints**: Verification at each story completion

**Evidence of Success**:
- Story 1.8: Initial documentation completion without implementation led to major gaps
- Post-workflow adoption: 0 critical issues across remaining stories
- Team adoption: 95% average quality scores after workflow implementation

**Specific Process Steps**:
```
1. Story Planning ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Documentation Update ‚Üí Completion
2. Never mark story complete without working implementation
3. Mandatory verification: "Can user actually perform the described action?"
4. Documentation reflects actual implementation, not planned implementation
```
