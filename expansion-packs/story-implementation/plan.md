# Story Implementation Expansion Pack Plan

## Overview

- Pack Name: story-implementation
- Description: End-to-end story implementation workflow from epic context to PR-ready delivery
- Target Domain: Agile development teams using epic-driven methodology
- Initial Scope: Phase 1 - Story Preparation (Epic → Story Ready for Development)

## Problem Statement

Current workflow (`.claude/commands/implement-story.md`) is overly complex and not functioning effectively. Need a progressive, testable approach that can be built incrementally.

## Phase 1 Implementation (Current Priority)

Transform epic context and story number into a complete, validated story ready for development.

### Components to Create

#### Agents

- [ ] story-implementation-orchestrator (REQUIRED: Custom BMAD orchestrator for Phase 1)

#### Tasks

- [ ] validate-epic-for-story (referenced by: po via BatchTask)
- [ ] create-story-from-epic (referenced by: sm via BatchTask)  
- [ ] validate-story-quality (referenced by: po via BatchTask)
- [ ] setup-development-environment (referenced by: infra-devops-platform via BatchTask)

#### Templates

- [ ] Uses existing story-tmpl.md from bmad-core (no new templates needed for Phase 1)

#### Checklists

- [ ] Uses existing story-draft-checklist.md from bmad-core (no new checklists needed for Phase 1)

#### Dependencies on Core BMAD Components

- [ ] po (Product Owner agent)
- [ ] sm (Scrum Master agent)  
- [ ] infra-devops-platform (DevOps Infrastructure agent)
- [ ] story-tmpl.md (Story template)
- [ ] story-draft-checklist.md (Story draft checklist)

#### Data Files Required from User

- [ ] Epic files in docs/epic{number}.md format
- [ ] Existing bmad-core configuration (no additional data files needed for Phase 1)

## Future Phases (Not Implemented Yet)

### Phase 2: Implementation (TDD Development)
- Backend/Frontend development coordination
- Checkpoint-based progress tracking
- Quality gates integration

### Phase 3: Quality Review  
- Architecture review
- Business validation
- Process compliance

### Phase 4: PR Creation & Delivery
- Final validation
- PR generation
- Documentation updates

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

- [ ] Orchestrator can execute epic → story preparation workflow
- [ ] All 4 tasks work independently and in sequence
- [ ] Story status progresses from non-existent → "Approved for Development"
- [ ] Environment is validated and ready for implementation
- [ ] Can be executed via `*story-implementation-orchestrator` command

## Approval

User approval received: [ ] Yes

## Notes

- Starting with Phase 1 only to enable iterative development
- Reusing existing tasks created during workflow development
- Progressive expansion approach allows testing and refinement
- Each phase will be added incrementally based on learnings from previous phases
